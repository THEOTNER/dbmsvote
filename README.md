Traditional voting systems have long been plagued by challenges such as poll booth capturing ballot stuffing and logistical constraints which undermine the credibility of election outcomes. In response to these challenges the concept of online voting has emerged as a potential solution to enhance electoral integrity and promote greater participation in the democratic process.</p>
